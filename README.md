Project MozES (Mozilla Event Station)  Project MozES is a small event hub that works out of box and support the Mozillians activity at events. We would like to move all things that we do to this box, for example: * Share information about Mozilla projects, products and values * Processing quizes fully digital form (we would like to move from paper quizes to digital) * Provide games that we cerated for Firefox OS * Provide games that related to IoT * All other ideas that may come during crating this device * Visitors can connect via open Wifi (so no internet connection is required) * Probably we can add a camera module to create fun time-lapse videos
